experiences:
    - role: Liver Transplant Coordinator
      time: September 2017 - Present
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I am responsible for end-to-end liver transplants. I am part of a team that assesses 
        and qualifies patients for liver transplants, this can mean making life and death decisions. 
        Once patients are on the transplant list, I teach them and their families how to manage their liver 
        disease and post-op care. When a liver is offered for transplant I coordinate a team of over 20 people
        to ensure that the liver is retrieved in the hospital of origin, matched to an appropriate patient, 
        a surgical and medical team are ready in theatre and ICU, and the patient and the organ are transported 
        to the hospital. This coordination takes place on a tight timeline which requires I anticipate and mitigate problems.
        Other responsibilities include carrying out monthly and annual audits of our database and organizing 
        teaching sessions for medical and nursing staff. This role has 24-hour on-call shifts.
        
        Achievements: I collaborated in a campaign throughout the hospital to promote organ donation, encouraging staff
        to identify and refer potential donors. We managed to increase the number of liver transplants by over 20% in one year. 


    - role: Senior ICU nurse
      time: October 2014 - September 2017
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        Responsible for the care of ICU patients, covering liver, major vascular surgery, cardiac, respiratory and renal conditions,
        working both independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. I requested further specialized training to work 
        in the High-Level Isolation Unit, this unit is the only one of its kind in the UK. During my period in ICU 
        I was responsible for configuration and use of complex medical equipment such as monitors, ventilators, IV pumps,
        cardiac devices and replacement therapy devices. I collaborated in preparing teaching sessions and was a mentor 
        for junior staff and students. As a senior nurse, on occasion I was the team leader. 
        I volunteered to be a “superuser” when we started using new software specific to ICU, giving medical and nursing staff
        training to use it correctly. 
        
        Achievements: I collaborated in a research study to implement a new assessment tool for confusion and delirium in ICU patients.
        Identifying delirium earlier reduced the medication given to patients and improved patient care.


    - role: Dialysis Nurse
      time: April 2013 - October 2014
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I provided individualised dialysis care to patients with chronic kidney disease, responsible for setting up 
        and managing the dialysis machines. I gave them education about lifestyle as renal patients. 
        I worked individually and as part of a specialist team. I was also responsible for the pharmacy stock and orders.
        
    - role: Dialysis Nurse
      time: June 2011 - September 2012
      company: La Paz Hospital - Infanta Sofia Hospital, Madrid
      details: |
        Similar duties as described above
         
    - role: Registered Nurse (Recovery and A&E)
      time: July 2008 - July 2010
      company: La Moraleja Hospital / Mostoles Hospital, Madrid
      details: |
        In Recovery I admitted patients right after surgery, for the immediate post-anesthesia period, 
        monitoring them and making sure they were stable and progressing well until they were fit for discharge to the ward.
        In A&E I was responsible of admission of patients, prioritising those who needed to be seen first (triage), 
        assessing them in collaborations with the medical team and providing treatment as needed. 
        I also managed emergencies and “crash calls” whenever they happened, working as part of a team.
