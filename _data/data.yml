experiences:
    - role: Liver Transplant Coordinator
      time: September 2017 - September 2019
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I was responsible for end-to-end liver transplants. I was part of a team that assessed and qualified patients for liver transplants. 
        When a liver was offered for transplant I coordinated a team of over 20 people to ensure that the liver was retrieved in the hospital of origin, 
        matched to an appropriate patient, a surgical and medical team were ready in theatre and ICU, and the patient and the organ were transported to the hospital. 
        This coordination used to take place on a tight timeline which required I anticipated and mitigated problems. 
        Other responsibilities included carrying out monthly and annual audits of our database and organizing teaching sessions for medical and nursing staff.
        
        Achievements: I collaborated in a campaign throughout the hospital to promote organ donation, encouraging staff to identify and refer potential donors. 
        We managed to increase the number of liver transplants by over 20% in one year.

    - role: Senior ICU nurse
      time: October 2014 - September 2017
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        Responsible for the care of ICU patients, covering liver, major vascular surgery, cardiac, respiratory and renal conditions, 
        working both independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. During my period in ICU I was responsible for configuration and use of complex 
        medical equipment such as ventilators, cardiac devices and replacement therapy devices. 
        I collaborated in preparing teaching sessions and was a mentor for junior staff and students. 
        I volunteered to be a “superuser” when we started using new software specific to ICU, giving medical and nursing staff training to use it correctly.
        
        Achievements: I collaborated in a research study to implement a new assessment tool for confusion and delirium in ICU patients. 
        Identifying delirium earlier reduced the medication given to patients and improved patient care.
