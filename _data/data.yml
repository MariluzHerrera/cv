experiences:
    - role: Liver Transplant Coordinator
      time: September 2017 - September 2019
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I was responsible for end-to-end liver transplants. I was part of a team that asses
        and qualifies patients for liver transplants, this can mean making life and death decisions.
        Once patients were on the transplant list, my duties included teaching them and their families how to manage their liver
        disease and post-op care. When a liver was offered for transplant I coordinated a team of over 20 people
        to ensure that the liver was retrieved in the hospital of origin, matched to an appropriate patient,
        a surgical and medical team were ready in theatre and ICU, and the patient and the organ were transported
        to the hospital. This coordination took place on a tight timeline which required I anticipated and mitigated problems.
        Other responsibilities included carrying out monthly and annual audits of our database and organizing
        teaching sessions for medical and nursing staff. This role had 24-hour on-call shifts.

        Achievements: I collaborated in a campaign throughout the hospital to promote organ donation, encouraging staff
        to identify and refer potential donors. We managed to increase the number of liver transplants by over 20% in one year.


    - role: Senior ICU nurse
      time: October 2014 - September 2017
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        Responsible for the care of ICU patients, covering liver, major vascular surgery, cardiac, respiratory and renal conditions,
        working both independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. I requested further specialized training to work
        in the High-Level Isolation Unit, this unit is the only one of its kind in the UK. During my period in ICU
        I was responsible for configuration and use of complex medical equipment such as monitors, ventilators, IV pumps,
        cardiac devices and replacement therapy devices. I collaborated in preparing teaching sessions and was a mentor
        for junior staff and students. As a senior nurse, on occasion I was the team leader.
        I volunteered to be a “superuser” when we started using new software specific to ICU, giving medical and nursing staff
        training to use it correctly.

        Achievements: I collaborated in a research study to implement a new assessment tool for confusion and delirium in ICU patients.
        Identifying delirium earlier reduced the medication given to patients and improved patient care.


    - role: Dialysis Nurse
      time: April 2013 - October 2014
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I provided individualised dialysis care to patients with chronic kidney disease, responsible for setting up
        and managing the dialysis machines. I gave them education about lifestyle as renal patients.
        I worked individually and as part of a specialist team. I was also responsible for the pharmacy stock and orders.

    - role: Dialysis Nurse
      time: June 2011 - September 2012
      company: La Paz Hospital - Infanta Sofia Hospital, Madrid
      details: |
        Similar duties as described above

    - role: Registered Nurse (Recovery and A&E)
      time: July 2008 - July 2010
      company: La Moraleja Hospital / Mostoles Hospital, Madrid
      details: |
        In Recovery I admitted patients right after surgery, for the immediate post-anesthesia period,
        monitoring them and making sure they were stable and progressing well until they were fit for discharge to the ward.
        In A&E I was responsible of admission of patients, prioritising those who needed to be seen first (triage),
        assessing them in collaborations with the medical team and providing treatment as needed.
        I also managed emergencies and “crash calls” whenever they happened, working as part of a team.
