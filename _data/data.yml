experiences:
    - role: Liver Transplant Coordinator
      time: September 2017 - Present
      company: Royal Free Hospital, London
      details: |
        I am responsible for end-to-end liver transplants. I am part of a team that assesses 
        and qualifies patients for liver transplants, this can mean making life and death decisions. 
        Once patients are on the transplant list, I teach them and their families how to manage their liver 
        disease and post-op care. When a liver is offered for transplant I coordinate a team of over 20 people
        to ensure that the liver is retrieved in the hospital of origin, matched to an appropriate patient, 
        a surgical and medical team are ready in theatre and ICU, and the patient and the organ are transported 
        to the hospital. This coordination takes place on a tight timeline which requires I anticipate and mitigate problems.
        Other responsibilities include carrying out monthly and annual audits of our database and organizing 
        teaching sessions for medical and nursing staff. This role has 24-hour on-call shifts.
        
Achievements: I collaborated in a campaign throughout the hospital to promote organ donation, encouraging staff
to identify and refer potential donors. We managed to increase the number of liver transplants by over 20% in one year.
